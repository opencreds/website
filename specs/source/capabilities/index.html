    <h1>Overview of Capabilities</h1>
  
    <p>
Capabilities are functionalities necessary to implement credentials on the
Web. We include capabilities specific to credentials but also capabilities 
that support a healthy credentials ecosystem, such as security, as it is 
important to understand the full context in which credential issuance, 
storage, and consumption occur.
    </p>
  
    <p>We organize capabilities into four groups.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Issuing</li>
  
      <li>Storage</li>
  
      <li>Management</li>
  
      <li>Consumption</li>
