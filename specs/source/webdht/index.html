The Web currently does not have a mechanism where people and
organizations can claim identifiers that they control. Identifiers,
such as those rooted in domain names like emails addresses and
website addresses, are often rented by people and organizations and
thus cannot be used for long-term identifiers. The danger is that if the
rent is not paid, all data associated with the identifier is temporarily
or permanently inaccessible. This document specifies a rent-free mechanism
where people and organizations can cryptographically claim identifiers that
they control and store data at those identifiers.

This is an experimental specification that is currently undergoing rapid
change and is not ready for widespread implementation. The reference

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
The Web currently does not have a mechanism where people and
organizations can claim identifiers that they control. Identifiers,
such as those rooted in domain names like emails addresses and
website addresses, are often rented by people and organizations and
thus cannot be used for long-term identifiers. The danger is that if the
rent is not paid, all data associated with the identifier is temporarily
or permanently inaccessible.
    </p>
    <p>
The reason this problem exists is because it's a particularly hard problem
to solve and there was no time to build out the solution when the Web was
starting its rapid rise in the late 1990s. The solutions that we have in
place today, particularly DNS, HTTP, and URLs, are powerful tools that have
scaled the Web to the billions of people that use it today.
    </p>
    <p>
However, as the Web grows and becomes more personal, there is a growing
need for a type of dereference-able identifier that can be created and
owned by people and organizations without the need for a central organization
or federation of organizations to control the namespace. Having such a
scheme would enable more personal and organizational freedom on the Web.

    <h2>Decentralized Identifier Registration Algorithm</h2>
    <p>
The following algorithm specifies how to register a decentralized
identifier in the WebDHT. The algorithm takes a <var>private key</var>,
a <var>public key</var>, and stores a <tref>DID document</tref>
in the WebDHT.
    </p>

    <p class="issue">
The discovery and storage mechanism for the final
WebDHT is still an area of active research and debate. The fundamental
technology used will most likely be a security hardened version of
Kademlia DHT algorithms that have gained widespread use in peer-to-peer
systems like tracker-less Bittorrent networks.
    </p>

    <ol class="algorithm">
      <li>
Create the <var>decentralized identifier</var> by generating a
version 4 UUID [[UUID]] and pre-pending the string <code>did:</code>
to the identifier. Example:
<code>did:a8ebdaf1-3c47-45d1-addc-26ce643b9a0c</code>
      </li>
      <li>
Create the <var>public key URL</var>. The URL value MUST be
compatible with the Linked Data Signatures [[LD-SIGNATURES]]
specification. The URL SHOULD be a DID-based URL that points
to a resource in the <a>DID document</a>. The URL MAY
be an HTTP-based URL or any other sort of dereferenceable URL.
Example:
<code>did:a8ebdaf1-3c47-45d1-addc-26ce643b9a0c/keys/1</code>
      </li>
      <li>
Set the <a>DID document</a> to a JSON-LD document with atleast the
following key-value pairs:
<dl style="margin-left: 1em;">
<dt><code>@context</code><dt>
<dd><code>https://w3id.org/identity/v1</code></dd>

The value of the <var>decentralized identifier</var>.
    </dd>
    <dt><code>publicKeyPem</code><dt>
    <dd>
The result of base-64 encoding the public key in PEM format.
    </dd>
  </dd>
</dd>
      </li>
      <li>
Add a signature to the <a>DID Document</a> by executing the
<a href="//web-payments.org/specs/source/ld-signatures/index.html#signature-algorithm">Linked Data Signatures algorithm</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
Discover the nodes in the WebDHT that will store the <a>DID document</a> and
for each node:

          <li>
Discover the <code>storageRequest</code> endpoint.
          </li>
          <li>
Perform an HTTP POST to the <code>storageRequest</code> endpoint with the
<a>DID document</a> as the body of the request.
          </li>
          <li>
Execute the <a href="proof-of-patience-algorithm">Proof of Patience</a>
algorithm and re-post the <a>DID document</a> when the proof has been
fulfilled.
          </li>
          <li>
This algorithm returns successfully when the acceptable number of copies
have been written to the WebDHT. The algorithm fails otherwise.
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>

If successful, the result of the algorithm listed above will be an entry in
the WebDHT where the key is the <var>decentralized identifier</var> and the
value is similar in form to the following example document:

    <h2>Creating an Alias in the DHT</h2>
    <p>
When creating <a>DID document</a> entries in the DHT, it is useful to also
create aliases for those entries to enable human-based lookup of identifiers.
For example, enabling the lookup of a <a>decentralized identifier</a> using
an email address and passphrase would help people boostrap the discovery
process using information that is easy for them to remember.
    </p>

    <p>
The following algorithm specifies how to register an alias to a
<a>decentralized identifier</a> in the WebDHT. The algorithm takes a
<var>hash value</var> and stores an associated <var>alias document</var>
in the WebDHT.
    </p>

    <ol class="algorithm">
      <li>
Create the <var>hash value</var> by using a well known hashing algorithm and
running it over a set of provided input text and then pre-pending the
hash algorithm identifier and a colon <code>:</code> to the hashing algorithm
output. For example, ask a person
for an email address and a passphrase, concatenate the input, and perform a
SHA-256 of the input which should result in the following example
<var>hash value</var>: <code>sha256:8cd07f3a5ff98f2a78cfc366c13fb123eb8d29c1ca37c79df190425d5b9e424d</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
Set the <var>alias document</var> to a JSON-LD document with atleast the
following key-value pairs:
<dl style="margin-left: 1em;">
<dt><code>@context</code><dt>
<dd><code>https://w3id.org/identity/v1</code></dd>
<dt><code>id</code><dt>
<dd>
The value of the <var>decentralized identifier</var>.
</dd>
</dl>
      </li>
      <li>
Add a signature to the <var>alias document</var> by executing the
<a href="//web-payments.org/specs/source/ld-signatures/index.html#signature-algorithm">Linked Data Signatures algorithm</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
Discover the nodes in the WebDHT that will store the <var>alias document</var> and
for each node:
        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>

    <h2>Updating Documents in the DHT</h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
The following algorithm specifies how to update a <a>DID document</a> that
has been previously stored in the WebDHT. The algorithm takes a
<a>decentralized public keys associated with the identifier</a> and stores a <tref>DID document</tref>
in the WebDHT.
    </p>

    <ol class="algorithm">
      <li>
Add a signature to the <a>DID Document</a> by executing the
<a href="//web-payments.org/specs/source/ld-signatures/index.html#signature-algorithm">Linked Data Signatures algorithm</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
Discover the nodes in the WebDHT that will store the <a>DID document</a> and
for each node:
        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>
Discover the <code>storageRequest</code> endpoint.
          </li>
          <li>
Perform an HTTP POST to the <code>storageRequest</code> endpoint with the
<a>DID document</a> as the body of the request.
          </li>
          <li>
This algorithm returns successfully if the minimum information
exists in the <a>DID document</a>, the signature is valid, and when the
acceptable number of copies have been written to the WebDHT.
The algorithm fails otherwise.
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p class="note">
Updates do not require the execution of the Proof of Patience algorithm as
the storage nodes need only check the existing public keys associated with
the <a>DID document</a> and verify the signature of the updated
<a>DID document</a> to result in a successful write to the WebDHT.

    <h2>Data Survivability</h2>
    <p>
In order for this technology to be broadly useful to society, it is important
that data stored in the WebDHT has excellent survivability characteristics.
The data stored on the network must be available as the system scales to
billions of devices using it, undergoes nation-state attacks, suffers
large failures and disruptions to the underlying communication networks, and
is affected by clients with a high network churn rate. A number of data
survivability considerations are listed and analyzed below with respect to
the algorithms provided in this document.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h3>Replication Requirements</h3>
      <p class="issue">
In order for data to survive most of the issues listed above, a high
mirroring rate is necessary. The algorithm to calculate the proper mirroring
rate is still under development.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Storage Location Randomness</h3>
      <p class="issue">
In order to survive a number of attack scenarios, it is best to have the
storage and mirroring locations be effectively chosen at random, but while
providing good discovery times. The algorithm to calculate the storage
location selection is still under development.
      </p>
    </section>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
    <p>
In order for this technology to be broadly useful to society, it is important
that the protocols and data used have certain security characteristics that
don't make it susceptible to attacks that would cripple the communication
channels or corrupt the data stored in the system.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h3>Distributed Dential of Service Attacks</h3>
      <p class="issue">
It should be assumed that private organizations and nation-states may
attack the WebDHT to try and disrupt activity since there are economic
and political incentives to do so. Many of the attack preventions rely on
slowing down requests using techniques like Proof-of-Patience, or ensuring
that all data is digitally signed to provide data protection. A thorough
analysis on DDoS attacks on each endpoint and system component is still
needed.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Attacks on Decentralized Identifiers</h3>
      <p class="issue">
An attacker may target a particular individual or organization in the
WebDHT to prevent that target from interacting with the broader network.
Some of the protections to prevent this sort of attack include
randomizing and migrating the storage and mirror location so that it is
difficult to predict where all of the mirrors will be at a particular point
in time. A thorough anaysis on targeted attacks on decentralized identifiers
is still needed.
