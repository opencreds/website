        <h1>Question 4</h1>
        <b>4. What is the most compelling Credentials use case that your organization would like to see better integrated into the Web that would be helped by one or more new standards in the space?</b>
        <p><em>Consuming</em><br>Company would like to be able to attach authenticated user identity to their outcome results for their performance during time at educational institutions using our software to facilitate their learning and assessment.  Company relies on strong identity assertions to prevent fraudulent access to our systems and data, and a standards based approach would lower our need to invent and maintain a proprietary solution to this problem.</p>

        <p><em>Issuing</em><br>Provide an interoperable standard for credentials on the web that allows for delegated issuance of standard web-based credentials to end users of a system.  As an example, a credential authority would be able to authorize 1 or more credential issuers which would in turn be able to issue secure credentials that are accepted as valid and acceptable by consumers of the authorities credentials. <span class="ednote">Added as issuing use case (@gkellogg).</span></p>

        <p><em>Managing and Sharing</em><br>We would like to let credential earners compose their credentials into representations that meet the needs of particular requestors, such as when job applicants package up a resume for the needs of a certain position opening. We would like to be able to better match up a particular credential against various parties’ needs for credentials, in an expressive way. “I am looking for a candidate who has experience with ‘scrum-based agile software development’”, for example.</p>

        <p><em>General</em><br>The Directive for Payment Services (II), legislation in Europe defines : ‘personalised security credentials’ means personalised features provided by the payment service provider to a payment service user for the purposes of authentication;     I do not know if this type of credentials is in your scope but, it is the most compelling matter we have so far.</p>

        <p><em>Consuming</em><br>Multiple credential issuers issue Jane a set of credentials for her shipping address, loyalty card, payment instrument, proof of age, and email address. When she goes to a new store to buy something, all of those credentials are requested by the merchant in a single credentials request. The credentials are delivered via the browser from Jane’s credential storage service to the merchant’s website and Jane initiates the payment process. Jane does not have to fill out any form information or register with the website to complete the purchase since her credentials contain everything the merchant needs to finalize the transaction.<span class="ednote">Scenarios and motivations above added as consuming use case (@burnburn).</span></p>

        <p><em>Issuing</em><br>A prospective user on a feature phone is able to register with a Mobile Money Wallet provider at a specific KYC tiered level. They register using shared secrets known only to the third party (could be government) Identity Provider (IdP).  The registration takes place via a feature phone - e.g. via USSD session or SMS messages.  Credentials are then stored with the Mobile Wallet provider and renewed automatically with the issuing authority.

        <p><em>Consuming</em><br>We do promote the use of LEI, the Legal Entity Identifier. This is
        focussed on banks, which will provide certainty in financial trades. E.g.,:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identification and storing in repository of trades between financial
            Institutions and customers;</li>
            <li>Due diligence in correspondent banking;</li>
            <li>Identifying banks with LEI is for some cases a more precise way than
            presently done through BICs, though we have no plans to change the usage of
            BIC in our RTGS payment system.</li>

        <p><em>General</em><br>Work being done at G3ict and Raising The Floor initiative seek to provide Assistive Technology from the cloud, which will require robust credentials to ensure privacy and security concerns, while still “opening the door” to access these types of cloud services. I see a standardized credentials system playing a big part in these efforts.</p>
        <hr>
        <p><em>General</em><br>Company provides services to hundreds of thousands of financial decision makers around the globe, and uses proprietary authentication mechanisms to provide access to these services. Many of our clients would benefit from being able to leverage our authentication mechanisms in their own web applications, whether those applications connect to Company services or are independent, but today it is difficult to achieve that integration due to the lack of standardization in this area. We also have a rapidly growing community of third-party application developers who provide applications to our clients, and integration of those applications with our authentication mechanisms is complicated by the proprietary nature of the mechanisms.  If Company was able to offer a standards-based credential provider that was usable by our clients in any compatible browser and by any compatible application, using only W3C Recommendation-defined APIs and protocols, this would be very beneficial to our ecosystem.</p>

        <p><em>Issuing</em><br>We wish to issue personal credentials to people who have met our requirements (exam or other evaluation).  We need these credentials to be verifiable as genuine by third parties. We need this to work in multiple languages. <span class="ednote">Added as issuing use case (@gkellogg).</span></p>

        <p><em>Issuing</em><br>Company is a the leading provider of electronic textbooks to higher-ed.  A large percentage (near 75%) of integrations with our partner institutions launch (open) an eTextbook through the IMSGlobal standard: Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI).  At present Company processes about two million LTI launches per month.  So the primary use case is: Student logs on to their learning system (LMS) and clicks an eTextbook icon that they would like to study.  Our LTI integration broker needs to subscribe the student if it’s their first visit.  Furthermore it needs to issue a license for the eTextbook if non currently exists.  Finally it presents the eTextbook contents to the student. <span class="ednote">Added as issuing use case (@gkellogg).</span></p>

        <p><em>Consuming</em><br>From the processor perspective, issues surrounding the merchant integration of retail with web shopping - there is great interest in cases where a customer will pay online and then pick up in in-store; or if a customer were to place the order online and then pay at the pick-up.  Additional areas of concern from instances of Card not present or online shipping where items may be delivered in split shipments requiring multiple authorizations or an item is on back order and the customer wants to complete the transaction - or even instances of advanced orders contingent on future availability.<span class="ednote">Scenarios above added as consuming use case (@burnburn).</span></p>

        <p><em>Managing / Sharing</em><br>Actors: job seekers/learners/employers Purpose: Credential discovery, identification, and comparison  By means of the Web, individual learners and organizations needing to make sense of the rapidly growing credential marketplace in order to make education/training and job seeking decisions want to quickly discover, identify, and compare available credentials and credential providers based on a number of criteria including, but not limited to: (1) type of credential, (2) scope of credential application (e.g., job types, geographic areas), (3) transfer value, (4) competencies addressed; (5) mechanisms of assessment, (6) prerequisite competencies, and (7) accreditation/endorsement status.</p>

        <p><em>Issuing / Consuming</em><br>We are building various decentralized applications (dApps) and platforms that all make use of our ID/Persona/Reputation system.  “Sign in” to these dApps is accomplished via the wallet that we have built which serves as a container for ID/Persona.  A small number of examples of the systems that use this ID/Persona/Reputation construct include Product, our prediction markets platform, our Poker platform, and Music Platform, our open music industry platform<span class="ednote">Scenario added as consuming use case (@burnburn).</span></p>

        <p><em>Consuming</em><br>We are primarily interested in credentials in relation to content and annotation ownership. Our use cases center around moderation of annotations, cumulative reputation for credentialed individuals, notification (where possible) to content owners that their content is being annotated or their annotations are being replied to, as well as content and annotation distribution and publishing vetted by a distributed reputation system (permission to publish based on merit, explicit permission).<span class="ednote">Scenario added as consuming use case (@burnburn).</span></p>

        <p><em>Managing / Sharing</em><br>Bank-ID: based on already executed Customer Due Diligince process at the bank, other service providers such as retailers may request trusted credentials for a specific customer, such as current address or age limits.  A retailer selling wine products on-line asks a customer to identify himself via the Bank-ID service. The customer logs in via a dialogue provided by his bank, using the 2FA token provided by the bank. After succesful sign-in, the bank makes the required data available to the retailer.</p>

        <p><em>Consuming / Sharing</em><br>A user wants to open his online banking portal, but he is on holiday and does not have his hardware token received by the bank with him. The banking portal requires a level of assurance level 3 to enter. According to ISO 29003/29115 (see annex B and table 5) it should be possible to use his combination of passport (primary level credential), driver’s licence and bank card of another bank(two secondary level credentials) and his insurance card (tertiary level credential) to access his bankin portal. However, he does not want to send those credentials over the internet, but the issuers of the credentials are asked to confirm per credential that the user indeed owns those credentials and that they are valid.<span class="ednote">Scenarios and motivations above added as consuming use case (@burnburn).</span></p>

        <p><em>Managing / Sharing</em><br>The use case is about electronic Payment  that required a user to be authenticate before the payment can be proceed. In the vision of a more distributed trusted environment (to be compare with today’s trust system  based on third party authorization)  the user will have to share its credential coming for various origin (official ID  , social network , bank, insurances telcos etc…) in an easy and secure way always keeping the control on them.</p>

        <p><em>General</em><br>International Wealth Management related to UX on-boarding into each respective financial institution along with it’s concomitant verification, authentication of credentials, documents and ultimately Legal &amp; Compliance requirements such as SOW and SOF which connect to FATCA (FFI). The salient driver is to bake the regs into the code so as to reduce the cost to comply by each institution, which in the USA is costly and often filled with weaknesses. This level of difficulty leads to turning down business and loosing clients and new potential relationships. When we can programmatically satisfy DHS, the FED, FinCEn, FINRA and the SEC (for example), we will reduce costs, enhance the UX and increase revenue opportunities.</p>

        <p><em>Consuming</em><br>Our Trade product allows users to trade on the network but users are required to provide KYC information before they can use their accounts.  Currently we use a third-party service which allows user to upload scanned copies of their relevant documents (passport, driver’s license etc) which, if not automatically verified, require manual verification.  Ideally users should be able to share digital credentials with us that cover all of our KYC requirements.<span class="ednote">Scenarios above added as consuming use case (@burnburn).</span></p>

        <p><em>Consuming</em><br>Company is involved in the issuance and consumption of credentials as “social currency” to prove reputation and ascertain privilege on the Web. A credential is defined as a digitally signed data document that represents authoritative claims issued by primary source data providers to an entity (i.e., person, place or thing.). First major use case: An example would be a nursing license issued by a government agency. The holder of a nursing license credential can offer it via their browser to a web site as proof of required attributes. For instance, if a web site requires a visitor to hold nursing license to gain access, the site would request the nursing identity credential from the visitor’s IdP to authenticate the visitor by inspecting and verifying the provided credential status and authenticity. The nurse should be able to keep private the use of the web site from the IdP. Second major use case: Prior to filling and handing over a prescription to a patient, a pharmacy needs to: ensure the doctor’s credentials are valid and none of them violate a business rule; that the prescription data has not been tampered with; and authenticate the person picking up the prescription is or is appropriately associated with or an official proxy of the patient. Using digital credentials, these processes can be largely automated and streamlined. For example, when a doctor who writes a prescription, a digitally-signed credential can be generated that contains the prescription and an identifier for the intended patient. Linked to the credential can be another credential that contains the doctor’s License, DEA Registration, National Provider Identifier (NPI), Medicare/Medicaid Enrollment Status and Exclusion/Debarment status. The patient can be issued a credential that can be used to prove they are associated with the identifier. The pharmacy prescription system can now independently verify all of the above via these digital credentials at the point of sale terminal or even over the Web.<span class="ednote">Scenarios above added as consuming use case (@burnburn).</span></p>

Originally only presence of the person in a shop and presentation of an identity document (ID Card, passport, etc.) was required. As it is a prerequsite e.g. even for MVNOs to sell mobile contracts (hence, SIM Cards) in supermarkets and via TV, copies of said documents, or the use of the national (proprietary) eID has seen some Adoption.<span class="ednote">Scenario added as consuming use case (@burnburn).</span></p>

        <p><em>Issuing / Sharing</em><br>We want to enable test takers to have a digital credential that represents a score report for pursuing opportunities in education, workforce, and personal endeavors.  We can do point-to-point distribution of score reports with current technologies and standards, but we seek a digital score report credential that will allow a test taker to do controlled, multipoint display and distribution (on LinkedIn, Credly, Parchment, Monster, or Facebook, for example). Such a credential will increase the utility and user control of their score reports.  Doing this requires ubiquitous web-based standards of the type being worked on by IMS Global, the W3C Community Group, the Dublin Core, and others to ensure validity, security, privacy, efficient display and consumption, issuer control, protection of intellectual property and business model, and similar requirements. <span class="ednote">Added as issuing use case (@gkellogg).</span></p>

        <p><em>Consuming</em><br>Age-restricted consumer products companies (CPGs) have largely been excluded from price-reduced promotions – a $500B market in the US - to targeted consumers largely due to the requirement to ensure the promotion does not encourage under-age sales.  Digital identity can provide value to the consumer, CPG and merchant by opening up this currently closed market to age-restricted sales.  A beer brewer wants to provide a digital promotion to an ‘of age’ consumer.  To obtain the promotion on their mobile, the consumer must prove their age to the beer company (so as not to run afoul of age laws) to obtain the promotion token.  Proof of age must be digital and tokenized, incorporated within the mobile device, and validated by a trusted service provider.  Upon validation of age, the brewer issues the promotion to the mobile, ideally with the age verification token embedded in the promotion token (for validation at POS).   The consumer then selects the promoted product at the convenience store, which is scanned at the POS.  The consumer elects to apply the promotion and passes BOTH the promotion token and age verification token to the POS which matches tokens.  With a successful match, the promotion is applied to the sale and price is discounted.  The store then ‘settles’ the promotion with the brewer; seeking payment from the brewer, retiring the promotion token and posting proof that age verification was assured for proof with regulatory agencies.  This same process – minus the token – can be applied in all age-validated sales within a convenience store; reducing or eliminating the store’s liability to under-age sales and keeping age-restricted products out of the hands of youth<span class="ednote">Scenario added as consuming use case (@burnburn).</span></p>

        <p><em>Sharing</em><br>Sharing credentials online across multiple stakeholder communities  w/out sacrificing insight to “evidence of success”, value of the outcome or earner’s privacy.  Company will provide, individuals a trusted and verifiable way to share the details of their professional accomplishments to any 3rd party recipient like employers, regulatory bodies and professional organizations.  An open standard would facilitate the transmission of this sort of data with many endpoints, so we can focus on a business model rather than data sharing protocols.</p>

        <p><em>Issuing / Consuming</em><br>One of the most compelling use cases for Company is issuance of Loyalty Cards.

        <p><em>Consuming</em><br>I think there are two use cases that would be important to Company.  The first is when verifying that new users are who they say they are.  We require that all users have a <a href="http://company.com">company.com</a> account in order to shop with us, so that either results in a returning user signing in or a new user creating an account.  It would be good to have the ability to verify with a credentials solution that the customer signing up with us was who they say they were.  The second case is relative to selling restricted items.  If we had a good way to validate a customer was qualified to purchase that restricted item with us then I think that could eliminate a good deal of friction from the process.<span class="ednote">Scenario added as consuming use case (@burnburn).</span></p>

The Health sector have a range of use credential use cases. For example, health practitioners in Country are registered in a national Health Practitioner Index which includes an opaque identifier, name and physical address details, an email/electronic address, and scope of practice. Health professionals send and receive e-prescriptions, e-referrals, e-assessments and other e-documents, and these need to carry identification details and current scope of practice for professionals involved.   The Education sector has a range of credential use cases, although they have not been able to provide examples at this time.  Both government and private sector organisations are interested in the potential credentials that can be provided by registration authorities - most of which has some legislative controls, such as registered engineers, real estate agents, immigration advisors, building practitioners, etc.</p>

        <p><em>General</em><br>Integration is difficult and time-consuming, and must be done for every application</p>
        <hr>
        <p><em>General</em><br>In my opinion the limitations of using credentials is that it is application specific, which limits the possibilities, portability and it is not user friendly. We need a way to use credentials on a layer above the TCP/IP or OSI application layer (e.g. an entity layer), which makes it possible to use it as Credential as a Service (CaaS). It must be taken out the application. This way it is possible to make it user friendly (easier to let the user decide which credentials are given which increases privacy) and increase portablity: the application asks the CaaS server to provide credentials for a specific level of assurance for a specific person, device, organisation or software. It gets information back to prove the asked level of assurance (I have multiple ideas about the how and what in this manner), but the main principle is this.</p>

            <li><em>General</em><br>OAuth1 provides assurance of partner identity
            (Publisher can trust UCLA is sending the message).  But Publisher must trust
            the university to accurately identify the user and the user’s role with respect
            to the course.</li>
            <li><em>General</em><br>OAuth2 loses message verification of OAuth1, but needs
            to be partnered with other identification protocols.</li>
            <li><em>General</em><br>SAML / Shib gives more highly trusted identity
            information than either OAuth but contains no course context (unlike LTI).  It

        <hr>
        <p><em>Endorsing</em><br>Authentication that a party to communication actually is the issuer or recipient of a credential is haphazard, currently relying on basic techniques like links sent to email addresses to verify a user controls the account. These techniques are workable, but they tie us into email as identifiers, so we run into issues when people change email addresses as they move from job to job or lose access to student accounts.</p>
        <hr>
        <p><em>General</em><br>No current technology standard available today provides a complete solution, each addresses a component of the problem of identity, content, sharing and storing credential data in a distributed way.    Some may claim that the technology exists, if so it is too piecemeal and/or difficult for a typical commercial entity or non-profit organization who owns the credential content to implement or interested employer/stakeholder to use.  The individual earner is stuck in the middle, relying on email to send PDFs and scanned images of paper certificates.</p>

        <hr>
        <p><em>General</em><br>The current methods are complex, insecure, very cumbersome and resource demanding.  All require too much overhead, don’t scale efficiently and are not easily distributable or extensible.</p>
        <hr>
        <p><em>Sharing / Management</em><br>The existing technologies work in a closed ecosystem and in point-to-point transfers where the parties are known in advance of the transaction.  They do not work in an open, user-controlled ecosystem where credentials are bundled and shared in a variety of ways across diverse contexts.  We need tools that allow credential validation, user controlled use and sharing, identity validation and association with the credential, and automated digital credential consumption within a transaction or application.</p>

            <li><!-- Moved into section 4.5 --><em>Endorsement</em><br>LTI is very useful to us.  But it’s credentialing

        <p><em>Issuing</em><br>With the exception of specifications defining properties and classes for micro-certification (e.g., OBI badge class), there are no formal specifications for the uniform description of the content, circumstances and context of formally promulgated credentials sufficient to support useful discovery, identification, and comparison. In the last decade, there has been an enormous growth in the number and variety of labor market certificates, industry certificates, occupational licenses in addition to micro-credentials as badges. This growth has intensified existing confusion among employers, workers, job seekers, students, and policy-makers about the quality and value of offerings in this expanding credentials marketplace–what do these credentials mean, what stands behind them, and how do they relate in terms of relevant features? There has been expressed interest in the DCMI community to support development of an open metadata specification for credential description to address this problem.</p>

    <h2>Design Criteria</h2>

    <p>
When exploring systems design, there are concepts that clearly fit into use
cases and concepts apply to all use cases. We are calling the latter class of
concepts <em>design criteria</em>, which are goals that should be kept in mind
while designing the overall credentials system.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Portability</h2>

      <p>
Ensure credentials may be easily moved from one <a>credential service</a>
to another.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
Yannos has been storing all of his credentials at his college credential service
and, upon graduating, would like to move them to a more long-term storage
service. All of the credentials are moved without having to re-issue or
re-assign any of the credentials.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Details</h3>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Rights</h2>

      <p>
Ensure credentials may be dynamically annotated with acceptable use information
when transmitted to <a>credential consumers</a>.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
Rosa is transmitting her email address to a group buying website and wants to
ensure that her email address will not be used for unsolicited emails. She
attaches a "no advertising" assertion to her email credential to
ensure that it isn't re-transmitted to 3rd parties for advertising purposes.
          </li>
        </ul>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Legacy Support</h2>

      <p>
Ensure the Credentials solution can provide an abstraction layer that
integrates with existing authentication methods
(eg: email, username/passwords, etc.)
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
Petra goes to login to a website, but does not have any credentials. She does,
however, have a username/password based account on the website. She is able to
bypass the credential-based login and use a username/password login instead.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Flexible Access Control</h2>

      <p>
Ensure that a <a>recipient</a> may provide access to their credentials
in an interactive and non-interactive manner. Access granted by the credentilee
may be revoked at a later time by the <a>recipient</a>.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
Ralph is buying wine at an online wine store. The wine store interactively
requests a proof-of-age and shipping address credential from Ralph before
completing the transaction.
          </li>
          <li>
The Good Food grocery store requests non-interactive access to each of their
customer's email credentials when they sign up for a loyalty card. If a
product recall notice is ever issued for an item a customer purchased, the
latest email address for the customer is fetched and the product recall notice
is forwarded to the customer.
          </li>
          <li>
Jackie allows TrustMart to automatically retrieve her latest address and phone
credentials. She then receives unsolicited junkmail that she knows came from
TrustMart. She deauthorizes TrustMart from pulling her latest address and phone
credentials.
          </li>

      <h2>Reuse and Extend</h2>

      <p>
Consider using existing, widely deployed identity provider mechanisms (e.g.
Facebook Connect, OpenID Connect, G+ Sign-In, etc.) to integrate with the
credential sharing process. Only invent a new mechanism if the current identity
provider mechanisms do not provide the functionality necessary to achieve
the use cases promoted by the group.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
Charlie uses an OpenID Connect login process to login to a website, which also
transmits his credential service URL. The website uses the credential service
URL to request additional credentials that the website needs to verify his
education credentials.
          </li>

      <h2>Identifier Alignment</h2>

      <p>
Enable credentials to be issued by systems in a way that allows each system
to align their internal identifiers with the other.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
Virginia Tech (a university) and the US Department of Education would like to
update the loan status of a particular individual. Both systems support
credentials, but neither of them desire to use the universal identity URL in
their internal systems (due to legacy system limitations). Both systems use a
common internal identifier, such as a loan ID embedded in a credential, to
align the data in both systems with the other.

  A learner named Olivia is choosing among summer internships, some of which
  offer opportunities to earn badges that are endorsed by her school. These are
  badges that could be used to fulfill an interest-driven learning graduation
  requirement her district has recently implemented. With the additional
  information provided to her by the school’s endorsement of certain badges,
  her choice among internships is made much simpler. This example came from the
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jzJXInqZCVft432_yFlKC4YIQZs_fv3zEX8Mfh4G6XY/edit">Open Badges Endorsement Framework Working Paper</a>,

  Health Education Alliance (HEA) is an industry association that provides
  professional development rating services for providers and specific learning
  modules. Emily works at Health Services International (HSI) and needs to take
  professional development courses. Her company pays 50% of the cost for modules
  she takes if they are endorsed by HEA.

  The last two examples are using a different definition of "endorsement" than
  the first two examples. The first two examples use a more technical definition,
  which is "endorsement as a layering or multiple signatures on a single
  credential (aka: the service provided by a notary public or witness)".
  The last two examples use a more functional definition, which is
  "endorsement as an official approval of a certain type of credential by a 3rd
  party (aka: the service provided by an accrediting organization)". Clearly all
  the use cases are valid, but we need to either define what "endorsement"
  means, or use other language that won't confuse readers (or both).
