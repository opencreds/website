A <em>verifiable claim</em> is a qualification, achievement, quality, or piece of
information about an <a>entity's</a> background such as a name, government ID,
payment provider, home address, or university degree.
The use cases outlined here are provided in order to make progress toward
possible future standardization and interoperability of both low and
high-stakes <a>claims</a> with the goals of storing, transmitting, and receiving
digitally verifiable proof of qualifications and achievements.
The following use cases focus on concrete scenarios that the technology created
by the group should address.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id='sotd'>
      <p>This document is an early version being used as an integration point for 
      a variety of use cases assembled from throughout the industry.  As the document
      becomes more mature this status will be updated accordingly.</p>
  </section>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
    The Verifiable Claims Task Force at the W3C is investigating
    the requirements around secure, verifiable, and richly descriptive
    "<a>claims</a>".  The goal of the Task Force is to determine if
    there is a sufficient understanding and need to merit the creation
    of a W3C Working Group to develop Recommendations in this space.
    </p>
    <div class="note">
        This document does NOT attempt to define an architecture for
        the support of Verifiable Claims.  Having said that, its very
        structure reflects some assumptions about how claims might be
        used in the real world.  These assumptions are
        derived from the use cases, not vice-versa.  Any solution that
        satisfies the complete collection of essential use cases would
        meet the requirements reflected by this document.
    </div>
    <section>
        <h3>Importance of this Work</h3>

        <p>People need to make many kinds of claims as part of their
        everyday lives.  
        As more important business moves to the Internet, people need
        to be able to transmit instantly <em>verifiable</em> claims about their
        accomplishments and qualifications. From educational records
        to payment account access, the next generation of web
        applications will authorize users to perform actions based on
        rich sets of credentials issued by trusted parties.
        Human-mediated decisions about job applications, collaboration
        and professional development will depend on filtering and
        analyzing growing amounts of data about individuals'
        experience and accomplishments. 
        </p>
        <p>Standardization of digital <a>claim</a> technologies makes it
        possible for many stakeholders to issue, earn, and trust these
        essential records about their counterparties, without being
        locked into proprietary platforms.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>How to Read This Document</h3>
        <p>This document is organized around the basic operations that
        might be performed on a Verifiable Claim.  For each of these
        operations, and for the additional section "Uncategorized /
        General", the document captures some high level use cases
        grouped by the requirement they represent.
        Each use case contains information about its motivation, relative
        priority, and one or more examples to help define the target
        beneficiaries of its support.

      <h2>How a Verifiable Claim Might be Used</h2>
      <p>Just to provide a basis for discussion, this section
      illustrates a simple example of how a claim might be used in a
      typical commerce situation.  Please remember that it is just an
      example, and should not be thought of as the canonical way such
      a system must be implemented.  First, consider this diagram:</p>
      <img alt='Example Flow Diagram' style='display:block; margin:auto' src="example.svg"/>
      <ol>
          <li>Jane decides to shop on the web site 
          WinesOfTheWorld.example.com (merchant).</li>
          <li>The merchant's site requires Jane be 21 years of age and
          requests Jane prove this (via a user agent-supported API call).</li>
          <li>Jane's user agent asks her <a>credential curator</a> for the
          proof.</li>
          <li>The <a>credential curator</a> shows her three Verifiable Claims
          it knows of that
          can assert this claim (e.g., her passport, driving
          license, and birth certificate).</li>
          <li>Jane selects one of these and authorizes that it be
          shared with the merchant.</li>
          <li>The <a>credential curator</a> returns the selected claim as a response
          to the user agent-supported API call, which in turn delivers
          it to the merchant.</li>
          <li>The merchant's server verifies that the claim is valid
          and satisfies the requirement.</li>
          <li>The merchant redirects the user agent to the web site
          with appropriate authorization.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
      <p class="ednote">
      Each use case in this section should have a unique human
      assigned identifier that starts with "uc".  The example
      use case (in the source below, commented out),
      which everyone should feel free to use a
      template, has the id "uc-example".  In order to disambiguate,
      please ensure that the subsection is added into the prefix (e.g.,
      uc-issuing-my-new-use-case). Also, please use hyphens instead
      of camel case.

              claim that she has right to drive a car (<a>claim</a>). She
              requests a verifiable claim from the certifying authority

When she goes to a new store to buy something, all of those credentials are requested by the merchant in a single credentials request. The credentials are delivered via the browser from Jane’s credential storage service to the merchant’s website and Jane initiates the payment process. Jane does not have to fill out any form information or register with the website to complete the purchase since her credentials contain everything the merchant needs to finalize the transaction.</p>

                  <p>Company provides services to hundreds of thousands of financial decision makers around the globe, and uses proprietary authentication mechanisms to provide access to these services. Many of our clients would benefit from being able to leverage our authentication mechanisms in their own web applications, whether those applications connect to Company services or are independent, but today it is difficult to achieve that integration due to the lack of standardization in this area. We also have a rapidly growing community of third-party application developers who provide applications to our clients, and integration of those applications with our authentication mechanisms is complicated by the proprietary nature of the mechanisms.  If Company was able to offer a standards-based credential provider that was usable by our clients in any compatible browser and by any compatible application, using only W3C Recommendation-defined APIs and protocols, this would be very beneficial to our ecosystem.</p>

                  <p>Self-asserted contact details use case.   Purpose  The Country Government does not want to build a centralised repository for citizen’s self-asserted credentials such as contact details and perhaps other claimed attributes such as partner’s name, etc. Alternatively, the objective is to support the marketplace to develop an ecosystem of local or global providers that offer the citizen a range of options to choose from. A standard could enable an approach that would remove dependence on any particular technology or platform as the choice of repository for an individual’s self-asserted profile – for example, personal mobile device, open cloud service, commercial provider website.     Agency and citizen requirements  •    The government agency requires an applicant’s contact details – that is self-asserted credentials; for example, email address, mobile phone, postal address, to complete their registration process for the agency’s online service.  •    If the customer changes one of these attributes, the agency would like the option of being notified.  •    The citizen wants the means to select specific contact details from their existing self-managed profile to share with this particular government agency.  •    If the citizen changes one of these attributes they want to be able to simply update their profile without explicitly notifying each government agency or organisation.  Use case – register with service provider  1.       Jane applies to the government agency for a social welfare entitlement.  2.       The agency requires Jane to authenticate and she uses her federated login credentials.  3.       The agency requests Jane’s full name, date of birth, citizenship and validated bank account.  4.       Jane opts to assert her online core identity, citizenship and validated bank account credentials from the authoritative providers.  5.       The agency requests Jane’s contact details.  6.       Jane opts to provide these from her online profile.  7.       The agency initiates a request to a credential/attribute brokering service.  8.       The brokering service checks Jane’s authentication token.  9.       The brokering service retrieves Jane’s identity, citizenship and validated bank account from the respective authoritative credential/attribute providers.  10.   The brokering service retrieves Jane’s profile from her preferred contact details repository mechanism (personal mobile device, open cloud service, commercial provider website, etc.).  11.   Jane selects some specific contact details.  12.   Jane provides information sharing consent (if not previously provided) to share identity, citizenship, bank account and contact details with the requesting government agency.  13.   The brokering service returns the respective credentials to the requesting agency.  14.   The requesting agency provides Jane with the requested welfare entitlement.  Related use cases  Other use cases for contact details would include initial create and manage contact details profile, service provider checks for contact details credential change, citizen notifies multiple service providers about a credential change.</p>

                  <p>Company is involved in the issuance and consumption of credentials as “social currency” to prove reputation and ascertain privilege on the Web. A credential is defined as a digitally signed data document that represents authoritative claims issued by primary source data providers to an entity (i.e., person, place or thing.). First major use case: An example would be a nursing license issued by a government agency. The holder of a nursing license credential can offer it via their browser to a web site as proof of required attributes. For instance, if a web site requires a visitor to hold nursing license to gain access, the site would request the nursing identity credential from the visitor’s IdP to authenticate the visitor by inspecting and verifying the provided credential status and authenticity. The nurse should be able to keep private the use of the web site from the IdP. Second major use case: Prior to filling and handing over a prescription to a patient, a pharmacy needs to: ensure the doctor’s credentials are valid and none of them violate a business rule; that the prescription data has not been tampered with; and authenticate the person picking up the prescription is or is appropriately associated with or an official proxy of the patient. Using digital credentials, these processes can be largely automated and streamlined. For example, when a doctor who writes a prescription, a digitally-signed credential can be generated that contains the prescription and an identifier for the intended patient. Linked to the credential can be another credential that contains the doctor’s License, DEA Registration, National Provider Identifier (NPI), Medicare/Medicaid Enrollment Status and Exclusion/Debarment status. The patient can be issued a credential that can be used to prove they are associated with the identifier. The pharmacy prescription system can now independently verify all of the above via these digital credentials at the point of sale terminal or even over the Web.</p>

                  <p>Age-restricted consumer products companies (CPGs) have largely been excluded from price-reduced promotions – a $500B market in the US - to targeted consumers largely due to the requirement to ensure the promotion does not encourage under-age sales.  Digital identity can provide value to the consumer, CPG and merchant by opening up this currently closed market to age-restricted sales.  A beer brewer wants to provide a digital promotion to an ‘of age’ consumer.  To obtain the promotion on their mobile, the consumer must prove their age to the beer company (so as not to run afoul of age laws) to obtain the promotion token.  Proof of age must be digital and tokenized, incorporated within the mobile device, and validated by a trusted service provider.  Upon validation of age, the brewer issues the promotion to the mobile, ideally with the age verification token embedded in the promotion token (for validation at POS).   The consumer then selects the promoted product at the convenience store, which is scanned at the POS.  The consumer elects to apply the promotion and passes BOTH the promotion token and age verification token to the POS which matches tokens.  With a successful match, the promotion is applied to the sale and price is discounted.  The store then ‘settles’ the promotion with the brewer; seeking payment from the brewer, retiring the promotion token and posting proof that age verification was assured for proof with regulatory agencies.  This same process – minus the token – can be applied in all age-validated sales within a convenience store; reducing or eliminating the store’s liability to under-age sales and keeping age-restricted products out of the hands of youth</p>

The Health sector have a range of use credential use cases. For example, health practitioners in Country are registered in a national Health Practitioner Index which includes an opaque identifier, name and physical address details, an email/electronic address, and scope of practice. Health professionals send and receive e-prescriptions, e-referrals, e-assessments and other e-documents, and these need to carry identification details and current scope of practice for professionals involved.   The Education sector has a range of credential use cases, although they have not been able to provide examples at this time.  Both government and private sector organisations are interested in the potential credentials that can be provided by registration authorities - most of which has some legislative controls, such as registered engineers, real estate agents, immigration advisors, building practitioners, etc.</p>

These values need to be secure and guaranteed to be associated with the student that generates them.  b. Another emerging standard governs Competency-Based Education.  This implies that the institutions learning systems can generate per-user transcripts of results associated with programs / courses / competencies.  (e.g., MBA / BusinessStats / MonteCarloSim).  In the large, these transcript’s can include college degrees, work accomplishments, etc.  eTranscripts require even stronger digital techniques to ensure the integrity of valuable statements of accomplishments such that, e.g., possible employers can trust their veracity.</p>

So in ACH its “I am John Doe, and here is my account information” in a digital token.  Closed loop cards as well.  ACH is just a set of rails, with no authentication beyond RTA – so credentials are key here (waiting for the first ACH breach to drive that home – with the source accounts drained and Reg E the only remedy)</p>

                  <h1>10. What are the limitations (if any) of the current technologies that you use for credentials?</h1>
                  <p>Verification is way too clumsy</p>
                  <hr>
                  <p>A lot of manual intervention is required to validate scanned documents. Local knowledge is often required to verify documents from different jurisdictions.</p>
                  <hr>
                  <p>Integration is difficult and time-consuming, and must be done for every application</p>
                  <hr>
                  <p>Cost</p>
                  <hr>
                  <p>In my opinion the limitations of using credentials is that it is application specific, which limits the possibilities, portability and it is not user friendly. We need a way to use credentials on a layer above the TCP/IP or OSI application layer (e.g. an entity layer), which makes it possible to use it as Credential as a Service (CaaS). It must be taken out the application. This way it is possible to make it user friendly (easier to let the user decide which credentials are given which increases privacy) and increase portablity: the application asks the CaaS server to provide credentials for a specific level of assurance for a specific person, device, organisation or software. It gets information back to prove the asked level of assurance (I have multiple ideas about the how and what in this manner), but the main principle is this.</p>
                  <hr>
                  <p>no established uniform standard</p>
                  <hr>

                  <ol>
                      <li>OAuth1 provides assurance of partner identity (Publisher can trust UCLA is sending the message).  But Publisher must trust the university to accurately identify the user and the user’s role with respect to the course.  2. OAuth2 loses message verification of OAuth1, but needs to be partnered with other identification protocols.  3. SAML / Shib gives more highly trusted identity information than either OAuth but contains no course context (unlike LTI).  It is considered too complicated for most higher-ed institutions and near-impossible for the burgeoning K-12 market.</li>

                  <hr>
                  <p>Authentication that a party to communication actually is the issuer or recipient of a credential is haphazard, currently relying on basic techniques like links sent to email addresses to verify a user controls the account. These techniques are workable, but they tie us into email as identifiers, so we run into issues when people change email addresses as they move from job to job or lose access to student accounts.</p>
                  <hr>
                  <p>No current technology standard available today provides a complete solution, each addresses a component of the problem of identity, content, sharing and storing credential data in a distributed way.    Some may claim that the technology exists, if so it is too piecemeal and/or difficult for a typical commercial entity or non-profit organization who owns the credential content to implement or interested employer/stakeholder to use.  The individual earner is stuck in the middle, relying on email to send PDFs and scanned images of paper certificates.</p>

                  <hr>
                  <p>The existing technologies work in a closed ecosystem and in point-to-point transfers where the parties are known in advance of the transaction.  They do not work in an open, user-controlled ecosystem where credentials are bundled and shared in a variety of ways across diverse contexts.  We need tools that allow credential validation, user controlled use and sharing, identity validation and association with the credential, and automated digital credential consumption within a transaction or application.</p>
                  <hr>
                  <p>a. LTI is very useful to us.  But it’s credentialing strength is limited to ensuring that identity of the <em>institution</em> we’re connect to (OAuth 1.0 signing).  We currently rely on the business relationship to ensure that the institution properly identifies the user and the user’s role.  b. As we move to more self-service modes (institutions that self-register) we can’t always rely on a trusted partnership so our business options are limited.  (Consider a bogus ‘MyGarage University’ self-registering and expecting free review copies of eTextbooks for its ‘instructors’).  We need stronger assurances that partners are who they say they are and are entitled to institutional or user status.  c. SAML 2 solutions provide us with higher quality identity but virtually no 'course context’ or ‘role’ information.  (LTI provides very rich educational metadata with each launch).</p>
                  <hr>
                  <p>We are using Identity Credentials, and they are designed to address deficiencies in OpenID, OAuth, and SAML, primarily.</p>

                  <p>With the exception of specifications defining properties and classes for micro-certification (e.g., OBI badge class), there are no formal specifications for the uniform description of the content, circumstances and context of formally promulgated credentials sufficient to support useful discovery, identification, and comparison. In the last decade, there has been an enormous growth in the number and variety of labor market certificates, industry certificates, occupational licenses in addition to micro-credentials as badges. This growth has intensified existing confusion among employers, workers, job seekers, students, and policy-makers about the quality and value of offerings in this expanding credentials marketplace–what do these credentials mean, what stands behind them, and how do they relate in terms of relevant features? There has been expressed interest in the DCMI community to support development of an open metadata specification for credential description to address this problem.</p>

      <p>The recipient authorizes the transmission of the credential(s).</p>
      <p>Credential Consumer Verifies Credential</p>
      <p>The Credential Consumer verifies that the credentials are valid.</p>
      <p>Credential Consumer Grants Access to Recipient</p>
      <p>The credential consumer grants the recipient access to a resource after verifying the credential.</p>

      <p>Recipient Collects Counter-signatures for Credential</p>
      <p>A recipient collects counter-signatures on a credential, reinforcing the credential’s authenticity.</p>
      <p>Credential Operations in Detail</p>
      <p>Issuing</p>
      <p>Issuer Advertises Credential Template / Badge</p>
      <p>Metadata</p>
      <p>There are important pieces of metadata associated with a particular Credential / Badge:</p>
      <p>Colorado State University is creating several recognition certificates to help foster a campus culture of leadership, tolerance and acceptance. The dean’s office defines the criteria and what evidence is accepted to prove that the recipient has met the criteria.</p>
      <p>Green Federal Credit Union has performed Know Your Customer clearing (driver’s license, background check, anti-money laundering blackslist check, etc.), on Reece and would like to issue a credential to him for use at other financial institutions.</p>
      <p>Harper High School teachers define soft skill credentials to award their students, using a web app that has badge defining and issuing features.</p>
      <p>The Veterans Affairs office is working on an initiative to translate military experience into digitized claims of the veteran’s skills to help veterans better connect with employment when they return from duty.</p>
      <p>The Project Management Institute which has been issuing Project Management certificates for many years is moving toward digitization of their existing certification program.</p>
      <p>Motivation</p>
      <p>The credential definition includes descriptive metadata about the circumstances and context in which the badge is issued to the recipient. The issuer clearly defines this information so others who later view or review the credential can understand the context behind it.</p>
      <p>Publishing Requirements</p>
      <p>An employer requires a specific technical certification on a job posting in order to ensure that the candidates will be experienced with the equipment to be used on the job.</p>
      <p>A school district posts the requirements for credentials from out-of-school learning programs to be accepted for school credit so that summer camp administrators know how to make sure their program counts.</p>
      <p>A college course lists certain credentials as prerequisites, so that students know how to plan out their academic year to be able to enroll in the course.</p>
      <p>An employer lays out a map of specific credential classes as a training plan for new employees, so that the employees and their supervisors can track and evaluate their progress.</p>
      <p>Motivation</p>
      <p>Consumers may publish requirements for credentials that qualify recipients for particular opportunities from the consumer.</p>
      <p>Vocabularies</p>
      <p>Education credentials use a common set of vocabularies to establish a credential type, alignment, and criteria.</p>
      <p>Healthcare credentials use a common set of terminology to express licensing status, prescription writing authorization, and which medical facilities the recipient has access to enter.</p>
      <p>Anti-money laundering credentials can be used to report suspicious activity on a global basis by using a common set of terminology to express people and organizations that are engaged in transactions.</p>
      <p>Motivation</p>
      <p>The interoperability of credentials depends largely on market verticals defining and standardizing common terminology in publicly available machine-readable vocabulary documents.</p>
      <p>Recipient Earns Credential</p>
      <p>Testing</p>
      <p>Sally takes the GRE.</p>
      <p>Motivation</p>
      <p>The results of tests could be shared more easily if they were produced in the form of a digital credential.</p>
      <p>Byproduct of Action</p>
      <p>Pele attends the EduConf 2015 conference.</p>
      <p>Motivation</p>
      <p>Credentials should be able to be issued as a side-effect of performing a particular real-world action.</p>
      <p>Issuer Issues Credential to Recipient</p>
      <p>Claims</p>
      <p>An issuer can make a variety of claims about a recipient:</p>
      <p>A teacher professional development association awards Penny Chen a digital certificate which claims she has fulfilled her professional development units and has demonstrated mastery over common core instruction.</p>
      <p>Brian is taking an online course on web development. When he completes modules, the website issues badges to him for module completion and progress through the course. At the end of the course he has an option to submit his work and quizzes that are evaluated and then he is issued a badge.</p>
      <p>The state government of California issues Amari a driver’s license after he passes both the written and practice driving tests.</p>
      <p>Educause conference issues digital badges to all conference speakers through a claim code system. Conference speakers are given a special code, that they input on the educause site which triggers a badge to be issued to them.</p>
      <p>Motivation</p>
      <p>An issuer can make a claim that asserts something specific about the recipient, such as a qualification, attribute, or the attainment of a particular defined achievement.</p>
      <p>Security</p>
      <p>It is important that an issuer ensure that a recipient is who they say they are before issuing important credentials to the recipient.</p>
      <p>Privacy</p>
      <p>Personally identifiable information must use known data fields in order to enable credential curation services to protect the recipient’s privacy.</p>
      <p>Accessibility</p>
      <p>A credential must be able to be issued to people that have disabilities (10% of the human population)</p>
      <p>Exceptions</p>
      <p>A recipient may not have a way to store credentials.</p>
      <p>Bearer Credentials</p>
      <p>Niambo would like to prove that she is over the age of 13 to get access to a protected website. She has a proof of age credential that can be used in a pseudo-anonymous fashion. She proves her age pseudo-anonymously, as the credential consumer website does not want to track its users, but does want to ensure that it is compliant from a regulatory perspective.</p>
      <p>Motivation</p>
      <p>It should be possible to prove that you have a particular attribute without leaking personally identifiable information.</p>
      <p>Privacy</p>
      <p>Two colluding websites should not be able to collude and build a more accurate profile of a person. There are many problems with this privacy requirement. Namely, the Open Web Platform provides multiple mechanisms like session tracking, supercookies, and email-based identifiers, that enable colluding websites to track their users across the Web. Given these existing tracking mechanisms, a bearer credential solution shouldn’t make the problem worse.</p>
      <p>Self-claims</p>
      <p>Mandy has years of experience as a web developer but as an autodidact, doesn’t have the credentials to prove it when applying for jobs. Mandy issues herself a credential and includes information/evidence to support her claim.</p>
      <p>Motivation</p>
      <p>A recipient should be able to make a claim that asserts something specific about herself, such as a qualification, attribute, or the attainment of a particular defined achievement.</p>
      <p>Identifier Aliasing</p>
      <p>One entity may have multiple identities that need to be tied together:</p>
      <p>Owen received a number of credentials issued to an employment-based identifier and uses an identifier equivalence credential issued by his employer to bundle these together with credentials issued to a personal identifier so that consumers will trust the different credentials were issued to the same recipient.</p>
      <p>Sally was issued a credential from her former high school to her then school email, sally@losalamitoshigh.edu. Sally has since transferred to a new high school and wants to be able to claim that credential still as hers even if her former high school email is no longer valid.</p>
      <p>When Jabar was 12, he took several online courses on Khan Academy using his parent’s or teacher’s emails, due to COPPA regulations that didn’t allow him to create his own account. During that period he earned various badges and certificates which, now that he’s 13, he’d like to claim under his own email address.</p>
      <p>Motivation</p>
      <p>A recipient may collect credentials asserting that multiple identifiers correspond to their identity so that they may present credentials issued to several of these identifiers at once, as long as the consumer of that statement trusts each of the equivalence credential issuers.</p>
      <p>A recipient must be able to claim credentials issued to different identifiers owned by the recipient.</p>
      <p>Security</p>
      <p>When sharing email accounts, forging credentials becomes easier/more commonplace. There are also accidental information leakage issues w/ shared credentials.</p>
      <p>Recipient Stores Credential</p>
      <p>Credential Storage</p>
      <p>A recipient of a digital credential may store it on a variety of platforms or media:</p>
      <p>Mayumi has earned credentials from many different issuing organizations including her college, online courses, social engagement platforms, etc. She is able to collect all these badges in one place on an online badge management and storage service. She is also able to use different services to manage her badges as she chooses.</p>
      <p>Liam saves all of his credentials on his laptop. He likes to have them there so that he knows where they all are and can upload them to various applications or send in emails.</p>
      <p>Sammie earns credentials for every book she’s read in her reading club. Her credentials are downloaded to an app on her ipad which gives her discounts on purchases of future books.</p>
      <p>Motivation</p>
      <p>A recipient of a digital credential may store it on a variety of platforms or media. Credentials must be portable.</p>
      <p>Consuming</p>
      <p>Credential Consumer Requests Credential</p>
      <p>Interactive Request</p>
      <p>Roxy visits the FineWines.com website and selects a number of wines to purchase. The website requests a proof-of-age and shipping address credential from Roxy. Roxy's IronVaultCorp credential service delivers both credentials, allowing her to finalize the transaction.</p>
      <p>A bank would like to perform &quot;Know Your Customer&quot; clearing on a new customer by checking to see that they are a citizen of Finland and that they have a current national ID card issued to them by their government.</p>
      <p>Jorge reads an article on BreakingNews.com and wants to engage in a discussion in the comments section. The website requests a verified email address credential to log him into the site. Jorge’s credential service delivers the credential, authorizing him to start posting comments.</p>
      <p>Mona sends an international/wire transfer that requests credentials for both the sender and receiver, greatly reducing the risk for the remittance by manually mis-keying the source and destination of the funds.</p>
      <p>Josie is a healthcare worker that has created a profile on a professional social network to make herself readily available for new opportunities in the workforce. She lists her employment history and credentials including degrees, certificates and digital badges. The website requests verification of her credential claims in order for her credentials to post. The website pings various credential vaults in which Josie stores her credentials and verifies them before allowing Josie to post them.</p>
      <p>Seraph initiates a transfer of $45,000 USD to her parents in Pakistan. She is asked to provide a credential used during the high-value transfer, further demonstrating that the correct person is authorizing the transfer.</p>
      <p>Janet visits SamanthasClub.com, and wants to view the member-only section of the site. The website requests her membership credential, which she provides. The website confirms her membership credential is valid and grants her access to the member-only portion of the site.</p>
      <p>Motivation</p>
      <p>A requestor may request to view credentials from a credential service that stores them. The service forwards the request to the credential recipient, who interactively authorizes transmission of some or all of the requested credentials to the requestor.</p>
      <p>Basic website login can be implemented using a credential.</p>
      <p>Legacy Support</p>
      <p>Petra goes to login to a website, but does not have any credentials. She does, however, have a username/password based account on the website. She is able to bypass the credential-based login and use a username/password login instead.</p>
      <p>Motivation</p>
      <p>Transition from username/password to credentials-based access will take years and some sites may never transition to credentials-based access. It’s important to continue to support username/password-based login for legacy sites.</p>
      <p>Recipient Authorizes Credential Transmission</p>
      <p>Recipient-initiated Transmission</p>
      <p>Umal wants to buy a PG-13 movie from an online retailer that requires proof of age. He provides a credential stating that he is over the age of 13 from an issuer that the store trusts. This enables the online retailer to avoid collecting information on a minor while ensuring that the proper age check is performed before granting him access to the movie.</p>
      <p>Marcus uploads a collection of badges he’s earned from several summer programs as part of an application for a summer camp counselor job. He chooses credentials that showcase his experience with relevant subject matter and competencies. The decision about who to hire for the job is too complex for a computer, so a camp administrator reviews Marcus’s application and considers the credentials’ applicability.</p>
      <p>Motivation</p>
      <p>A credential recipient may upload one or more credentials to a consumer service or transmit credentials by email in order to apply to access an opportunity or service. The request may be evaluated by an automated system or by a human adjudicator.</p>
      <p>Social Sharing</p>
      <p>Chiara, who is seeking new career opportunities, wants to share a list of her credentials with a recruiter. She takes her credentials from her desktop and includes them as an attachment to an email she sends the recruiter. The badges retain their integrity and content.</p>
      <p>Beaver is thrilled to have earned the Associated Student Board Leader of the Year commendation. He wants to shout it from the rooftops and accordingly shares it on his various social media accounts including Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.</p>
      <p>Motivation</p>
      <p>A recipient of a digital credential may choose to share their credential through a variety of mediums, whether email, embed or social media.</p>
      <p>Data Rights</p>
      <p>Rosa is transmitting her email address to a group buying website and wants to ensure that her email address will not be used for unsolicited emails. She attaches a &quot;no advertising&quot; assertion to her email credential to ensure that it isn't re-transmitted to 3rd parties for advertising purposes.</p>
      <p>Motivation</p>
      <p>A recipient of a digital credential may choose to include information that asserts what their information may be used for.</p>
      <p>Composability</p>
      <p>Credentials may be displayed together in order to meet complex requirements:</p>
      <p>Marisol wants to open a bank account at a new bank. The bank requires two valid forms of identification. She uses a US Passport credential and a Colorado driver’s license credential to prove that she is who she says she is to the bank.</p>
      <p>Willie is transferring between universities and wants to ensure he gets credit for work he did at his old school, so he bundles the credentials he received for his course work with a 3rd party’s endorsements that he knows the new school trusts, so that the new school is more likely to accept the credentials.</p>
      <p>Idris wants to take the introduction to organic chemistry which is an upper division course. In order to qualify for that course, Idris needs to have proven that he’s taken Biochemistry and Physics. He proves that he’s taken these prerequisite courses which unlocks the opportunity to enroll in the organic chemistry course.</p>
      <p>Motivation</p>
      <p>Credentials may be displayed together in order to meet complex requirements or prove qualification more substantively than would be possible with one credential alone.</p>
      <p>Credential Consumer Verifies a digital credential may verify that the credential is an authentic statement of an issuer’s claims about the recipient. The verifying entity must have the capability to connect the issuer’s identity to its credential identifier and the recipient’s identity to their identifier as indicated in the credential. The issuer’s verification information, such as its public key, must be discoverable from the credential record and verifiably linked to the issuer.</p>
      <p>Pseudo-anonymity</p>
      <p>June goes to her local beer and wine store to buy a bottle of wine. She submits her identity credential that lets the liquor store owner know that she is over 21 without having to reveal her actual DOB.</p>
      <p>A credential contains an identifier that is a hash of a known identifier (email address) of an individual so that those who know the recipient identifier can verify the credential, but those who don’t know the identifier cannot derive personally identifiable information about the recipient.</p>
      <p>Motivation</p>
      <p>Credentials may be issued to an identifier such that it is possible for the recipient to prove that the identifier corresponds to them without revealing personally identifiable information. In the case of a subpoena, an identity service may be compelled to reveal additional information beyond what the holder of the identity wished to transmit.</p>
      <p>Credential Consumer Grants Access to Recipient</p>
      <p>Searchability</p>
      <p>Steve, an HR recruiter searches his database of job-seekers for a position that requires a particular defined credential.Steve narrows a list of candidates to those who have a valid passport credential.</p>
      <p>Motivation</p>
      <p>A credential consumer who has been presented credentials from a large number of candidates can sort and filter those candidates by credentials they have received and claims made by those credentials.</p>
      <p>Managing</p>
      <p>Recipient Authorizes a Credential to be Read Asynchronously</p>
      <p>Non-interactive Transmission</p>
      <p>When performing straight-through-processing, a correspondent banking client would like to prove proper “Know Your Customer” (KYC) clearing of the transaction by including the KYC credentials for the sender and receiver of the transaction.</p>
      <p>A grocery store wants to send out a product recall notice and requests an up-to-date email address from each of their customers' credential service to ensure that they're sending it to the correct email address. Mary has previously authorized the store for ongoing access to one of her verified email address credentials, so this credential is transmitted without bothering Mary with an interactive authorization request.</p>
      <p>Calvin applies for a job at a biotech company. He authorizes the job service acting on behalf of the biotech company to access his verified undergrad and grad school credentials along with his digital badges which he’s curated for the company to review that he thinks exemplifies his work, experiences and qualifications for the job. This collection of credentials are transmitted to the job service and used as a way to automate the initial screening of applicants.</p>
      <p>Jackie allows TrustMart to automatically retrieve her latest address and phone credentials. She then receives unsolicited junkmail that she knows came from TrustMart. She deauthorizes TrustMart from pulling her latest address and phone credentials.</p>
      <p>Motivation</p>
      <p>A credential recipient may pre-authorize the public or specific requestors to access certain credentials through a credential service.</p>
      <p>Recipient Displays Credentials to Various Entities Based on an Access Control List</p>
      <p>Portability</p>
      <p>A recipient moves their credential between different storage locations, without losing the ability to transmit or authenticate it:</p>
      <p>Amy stores her credentials on a local hard drive, then later wants to upload them to a resume-building service for sharing with prospective employers.</p>
      <p>When Bruce graduates from college, he moves his credentials from the university’s credential store to a different service.</p>
      <p>Charlie would like to make a backup of his credentials by storing them on a second credential vault service.</p>
      <p>When transferring to UCLA, harice is able to also transfer her lower division credits from Santa Monica College to UCLA’s credential store.</p>
      <p>Motivation</p>
      <p>A recipient moves their credential between different storage locations, without losing the ability to transmit or authenticate it.</p>
      <p>Repudiability</p>
      <p>Credential recipients should have the ability to repudiate any credential issued to them:</p>
      <p>Rosa works with a community support worker at a public-access credentialing service to get a credential publicly “doxxing” her by listing her home address taken down to protect her safety.</p>
      <p>Marie disputes the validity of a credential making claims about her and publishes a verifiable repudiation of that credential.</p>
      <p>Motivation</p>
      <p>Credential recipients should have the ability to repudiate any credential issued to them, which could take the form of takedown requests to platforms where harmful, or misleading information about them is available.</p>
      <p>Privacy</p>
      <p>Credential Service must establish a takedown request procedure</p>
      <!-- moved into section 4.5 
<p>Endorsing</p>
<p>Recipient Collects Counter-signatures for Credential</p>
<p>Endorsement</p>
<p>Two people get married and get a marriage credential which needs to be digitally signed by the person that married them and the witness, in that order. The credential is first issued by the person that married them, and is then counter-signed by the witness.</p>
<p>MidBank is attempting to establish a solid credit rating and hires three credit ratings agencies to audit its books. Each firm determines that the bank should have a AA credit rating and digitally countersigns the same credential 3 times to demonstrate the credit worthiness of the bank.</p>
<p>Olivia is choosing among summer internships, some of which offer opportunities to earn badges that are endorsed by her school. These are badges that could be used to fulfill an interest-driven learning graduation requirement her district has recently implemented. With the additional information provided to her by the school’s endorsement of certain badges, her choice among internships is made much simpler. This example came from the Open Badges Endorsement Framework Working Paper, which was created by the Badge Alliance Endorsement Working Group.</p>
<p>Motivation</p>
<p>Parties other than a credential’s issuer may be able to add value for certain consumers by endorsing it. An individual recipient’s credential may be endorsed in order for a third party to strengthen the claims it makes about that recipient. A defined credential class may be endorsed by a consumer or other outside entity in order to extend trust to the recipients of that credential among consumer entities who trust the endorser.</p>
<p>Endorsement on self-claims</p>
<p>After Mandy issues herself a credential with the supporting evidence and information, she reaches out to her previous clients including various sized organizations for which she’s done development work requesting they endorse the self-issued credential. Several organizations oblige and endorse the credential.</p>
<p>Motivation</p>
<p>An organization or individual can endorse a self-made claim by a recipient that asserts something specific about herself, such as a qualification, attribute, or the attainment of a particular defined achievement.</p>

    <h2>An Overview of Phases of Credential Usage</h2>

    <p>While the credentials specifications are intended to allow for their use in a variety of industries and scenarios, there are consistent phases to the procedure as defined below.</p>

    <h2>Design Criteria</h2>

    <p>
When exploring systems design, there are concepts that clearly fit into use
cases and concepts apply to all use cases. We are calling the latter class of
concepts <em>design criteria</em>, which are goals that should be kept in mind
while designing the overall credentials system.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Portability</h2>

      <p>
Ensure credentials may be easily moved from one <a>credential service</a>
to another.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
Yannos has been storing all of his credentials at his college credential service
and, upon graduating, would like to move them to a more long-term storage
service. All of the credentials are moved without having to re-issue or
re-assign any of the credentials.
          </li>
        </ul>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Rights</h2>

      <p>
Ensure credentials may be dynamically annotated with acceptable use information
when transmitted to <a>credential consumers</a>.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
Rosa is transmitting her email address to a group buying website and wants to
ensure that her email address will not be used for unsolicited emails. She
attaches a "no advertising" assertion to her email credential to
ensure that it isn't re-transmitted to 3rd parties for advertising purposes.

      <h2>Legacy Support</h2>

      <p>
Ensure the Credentials solution can provide an abstraction layer that
integrates with existing authentication methods
(eg: email, username/passwords, etc.)
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
Petra goes to login to a website, but does not have any credentials. She does,
however, have a username/password based account on the website. She is able to
bypass the credential-based login and use a username/password login instead.

      <h2>Flexible Access Control</h2>

      <p>
Ensure that a <a>recipient</a> may provide access to their credentials
in an interactive and non-interactive manner. Access granted by the credentilee
may be revoked at a later time by the <a>recipient</a>.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
Ralph is buying wine at an online wine store. The wine store interactively
requests a proof-of-age and shipping address credential from Ralph before
completing the transaction.
          </li>
          <li>
The Good Food grocery store requests non-interactive access to each of their
customer's email credentials when they sign up for a loyalty card. If a
product recall notice is ever issued for an item a customer purchased, the
latest email address for the customer is fetched and the product recall notice
is forwarded to the customer.
          </li>
          <li>
Jackie allows TrustMart to automatically retrieve her latest address and phone
credentials. She then receives unsolicited junkmail that she knows came from
TrustMart. She deauthorizes TrustMart from pulling her latest address and phone
credentials.

      <h2>Reuse and Extend</h2>

      <p>
Consider using existing, widely deployed identity provider mechanisms (e.g.
Facebook Connect, OpenID Connect, G+ Sign-In, etc.) to integrate with the
credential sharing process. Only invent a new mechanism if the current identity
provider mechanisms do not provide the functionality necessary to achieve
the use cases promoted by the group.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
Charlie uses an OpenID Connect login process to login to a website, which also
transmits his credential service URL. The website uses the credential service
URL to request additional credentials that the website needs to verify his
education credentials.

      <h2>Identifier Alignment</h2>

      <p>
Enable credentials to be issued by systems in a way that allows each system
to align their internal identifiers with the other.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
Virginia Tech (a university) and the US Department of Education would like to
update the loan status of a particular individual. Both systems support
credentials, but neither of them desire to use the universal identity URL in
their internal systems (due to legacy system limitations). Both systems use a
common internal identifier, such as a loan ID embedded in a credential, to
align the data in both systems with the other.
          </li>

    A credential may be endorsed/counter-signed by one or more entities.
    Signatures can be either dependent on one another (chained together), or
    multiple signatures on original credential (part of a mathematical Set).

  MidBank is attempting to establish a solid credit rating and hires three credit

  have a AA credit rating and digitally countersigns the same credential 3 times
  to demonstrate the credit worthiness of the bank.

            <li>
  Two people get married and get a marriage credential which needs to be
  digitally signed by the person that married them and the witness, in that order.
  The credential is first issued by the person that married them, and is then
  counter-signed by the witness.

  A learner named Olivia is choosing among summer internships, some of which
  offer opportunities to earn badges that are endorsed by her school. These are
  badges that could be used to fulfill an interest-driven learning graduation
  requirement her district has recently implemented. With the additional
  information provided to her by the school’s endorsement of certain badges,
  her choice among internships is made much simpler. This example came from the
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jzJXInqZCVft432_yFlKC4YIQZs_fv3zEX8Mfh4G6XY/edit">Open Badges Endorsement Framework Working Paper</a>,

  Horizon Learning (HL) develops healthcare professional development modules.
  Health Education Alliance (HEA) is an industry association that provides
  professional development rating services for providers and specific learning
  modules. Emily works at Health Services International (HSI) and needs to take
  professional development courses. Her company pays 50% of the cost for modules
  she takes if they are endorsed by HEA.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="ednote">
  The last two examples are using a different definition of "endorsement" than
  the first two examples. The first two examples use a more technical definition,
  which is "endorsement as a layering or multiple signatures on a single
  credential (aka: the service provided by a notary public or witness)".
  The last two examples use a more functional definition, which is
  "endorsement as an official approval of a certain type of credential by a 3rd
  party (aka: the service provided by an accrediting organization)". Clearly all
  the use cases are valid, but we need to either define what "endorsement"
  means, or use other language that won't confuse readers (or both).
