A <em>verifiable claim</em> is a qualification, achievement, quality, or piece of
information about an <a>entity's</a> background such as a name, government ID,
payment provider, home address, or university degree.
The use cases outlined here are provided in order to make progress toward
possible future standardization and interoperability of both low and
high-stakes <a>claims</a> with the goals of storing, transmitting, and receiving
digitally verifiable proof of qualifications and achievements.
The following use cases focus on concrete scenarios that the technology created
by the group should address.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id='sotd'>
      <p>This document is an early version being used as an integration point for 
      a variety of use cases assembled from throughout the industry.  As the document
      becomes more mature this status will be updated accordingly.</p>
  </section>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
    The Verifiable Claims Task Force at the W3C is investigating
    the requirements around secure, verifiable, and richly descriptive
    "<a>claims</a>".  The goal of the Task Force is to determine if
    there is a sufficient understanding and need to merit the creation
    of a W3C Working Group to develop Recommendations in this space.
    </p>
    <div class="note">
        This document does NOT attempt to define an architecture for
        the support of Verifiable Claims.  Having said that, its very
        structure reflects some assumptions about how claims might be
        used in the real world.  These assumptions are
        derived from the use cases, not vice-versa.  Any solution that
        satisfies the complete collection of essential use cases would
        meet the requirements reflected by this document.
    </div>
    <section>
        <h3>Importance of this Work</h3>

        <p>People need to make many kinds of claims as part of their
        everyday lives.  
        As more important business moves to the Internet, people need
        to be able to transmit instantly <em>verifiable</em> claims about their
        accomplishments and qualifications. From educational records
        to payment account access, the next generation of web
        applications will authorize users to perform actions based on
        rich sets of credentials issued by trusted parties.
        Human-mediated decisions about job applications, collaboration
        and professional development will depend on filtering and
        analyzing growing amounts of data about individuals'
        experience and accomplishments. 
        </p>
        <p>Standardization of digital <a>claim</a> technologies makes it
        possible for many stakeholders to issue, earn, and trust these
        essential records about their counterparties, without being
        locked into proprietary platforms.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>How to Read This Document</h3>
        <p>This document is organized around the basic operations that
        might be performed on a Verifiable Claim.  For each of these
        operations, and for the additional section "Uncategorized /
        General", the document captures some high level use cases
        grouped by the requirement they represent.
        Each use case contains information about its motivation, relative
        priority, and one or more examples to help define the target
        beneficiaries of its support.

      <h2>How a Verifiable Claim Might be Used</h2>
      <p>Just to provide a basis for discussion, this section
      illustrates a simple example of how a claim might be used in a
      typical commerce situation.  Please remember that it is just an
      example, and should not be thought of as the canonical way such
      a system must be implemented.  First, consider this diagram:</p>
      <img alt='Example Flow Diagram' style='display:block; margin:auto' src="example.svg"/>
      <ol>
          <li>Jane decides to shop on the web site 
          WinesOfTheWorld.example.com (merchant).</li>
          <li>The merchant's site requires Jane be 21 years of age and
          requests Jane prove this (via a user agent-supported API call).</li>
          <li>Jane's user agent asks her <a>credential curator</a> for the
          proof.</li>
          <li>The <a>credential curator</a> shows her three Verifiable Claims
          it knows of that
          can assert this claim (e.g., her passport, driving
          license, and birth certificate).</li>
          <li>Jane selects one of these and authorizes that it be
          shared with the merchant.</li>
          <li>The <a>credential curator</a> returns the selected claim as a response
          to the user agent-supported API call, which in turn delivers
          it to the merchant.</li>
          <li>The merchant's server verifies that the claim is valid
          and satisfies the requirement.</li>
          <li>The merchant redirects the user agent to the web site
          with appropriate authorization.</li>

      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
      <p class="ednote">
      Each use case in this section should have a unique human
      assigned identifier that starts with "uc".  The example
      use case (in the source below, commented out),
      which everyone should feel free to use a
      template, has the id "uc-example".  In order to disambiguate,
      please ensure that the subsection is added into the prefix (e.g.,
      uc-issuing-my-new-use-case). Also, please use hyphens instead
      of camel case.

              claim that she has right to drive a car (<a>claim</a>). She
              requests a verifiable claim from the certifying authority
              (<a>issuer</a>) that she can use to prove to the officer
              (<a>credential consumer</a>) that her <a>claim</a> is
              valid.
            </dd>
            <dd>Jane would like to get a digitally signed credential for her checking
              account at MidBank. MidBank offers to provide a credential asserting

              checking account.</dd>
            <dd>Company is a the leading provider of electronic textbooks to
              higher-ed. A large percentage (near 75%) of integrations with our
              partner institutions launch (open) an eTextbook through the
              IMSGlobal standard: Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI). At
              present Company processes about two million LTI launches per
              month. So the primary use case is: Student logs on to their
              learning system (LMS) (<a>credential consumer</a>) and clicks an
              eTextbook icon that they would like to study (<a>claim</a>). Our
              LTI integration broker (<a>issuer</a>) needs to subscribe the
              student if it’s their first visit. Furthermore it needs to issue
              a license (<a>credential</a>) for the eTextbook if non currently
              exists. Finally it presents the eTextbook contents to the
              student.</dd>

            <dd>
              <p>Purpose  The Country Government does not want to build a centralised repository for citizen’s self-asserted credentials such as contact details and perhaps other claimed attributes such as partner’s name, etc. Alternatively, the objective is to support the marketplace to develop an ecosystem of local or global providers that offer the citizen a range of options to choose from. A standard could enable an approach that would remove dependence on any particular technology or platform as the choice of repository for an individual’s self-asserted profile – for example, personal mobile device, open cloud service, commercial provider website.</p> 
              <p>Agency and citizen requirements:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>The government agency requires an applicant’s contact details – that is self-asserted credentials; for example, email address, mobile phone, postal address, to complete their registration process for the agency’s online service.</li>
              <li>If the customer changes one of these attributes, the agency would like the option of being notified.</li>
              <li>The citizen wants the means to select specific contact details from their existing self-managed profile to share with this particular government agency.</li>
              <li>If the citizen changes one of these attributes they want to be able to simply update their profile without explicitly notifying each government agency or organisation.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Use case – register with service provider</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Jane applies to the government agency for a social welfare entitlement.</li>
                <li>The agency requires Jane to authenticate and she uses her federated login credentials.</li>
                <li>The agency requests Jane’s full name, date of birth, citizenship and validated bank account.</li>
                <li>Jane opts to assert her online core identity, citizenship and validated bank account credentials from the authoritative providers.</li>
                <li>The agency requests Jane’s contact details.</li>
                <li>Jane opts to provide these from her online profile.</li>
                <li>The agency initiates a request to a credential/attribute brokering service.</li>
                <li>The brokering service checks Jane’s authentication token.</li>
                <li>The brokering service retrieves Jane’s identity, citizenship and validated bank account from the respective authoritative credential/attribute providers.</li>
                <li>The brokering service retrieves Jane’s profile from her preferred contact details repository mechanism (personal mobile device, open cloud service, commercial provider website, etc.).</li>
                <li>Jane selects some specific contact details.</li>
                <li>Jane provides information sharing consent (if not previously provided) to share identity, citizenship, bank account and contact details with the requesting government agency.</li>
                <li>The brokering service returns the respective credentials to the requesting agency.</li>
                <li>The requesting agency provides Jane with the requested welfare entitlement.</li>
              </ol>
            </dd>
            <dd>Related use cases  Other use cases for contact details would include initial create and manage contact details profile, service provider checks for contact details credential change, citizen notifies multiple service providers about a credential change.</dd>

                  trusted entities.  A credential consumer could examine these endorsements to

                  <dd>Jim shares a Verifiable Claim with a prospective employer about the results of taking 
                  a certification course.
                  The claim was issued by the course provider - Bob's School o' Programming.  
                  The employer's system looks at the claim, but is not familiar with the issuer. 
                  The issuer has included a URI for their own Verifiable Claim in the certification,
                  and the employer's system retrieves that.  
                  The issuer's claim was issued by "Big Computer Corporation", a multi-national that
                  the employer's system <em>is</em> familiar with.

                  <dd>Big Testing Service (BTS) provides online test management for a large collection of
                  training organizations - connecting those organizations to various online testing
                  providers and capturing test results. Systems such as LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) 
                  can be used by BTS to certify that they are who they are, and the
                  online testing providers are who they claim to be.  Unfortunately, LTI does not
                  extend to the tire of BTS' clients, nor to the end users who are taking the tests.  
                  Organizations outside of that
                  community need a way to know that Verifiable Claims issued by BTS and their clients
                  are valid.  Endorsement of the BTS claims by the online testing providers, and
                  endorsement of BTS clients by BTS, helps establish the trusted relationship.</dd>

Many of our clients would benefit from being able to leverage our authentication mechanisms in their own web applications, whether those applications connect to Company services or are independent, but today it is difficult to achieve that integration due to the lack of standardization in this area. We also have a rapidly growing community of third-party application developers who provide applications to our clients, and integration of those applications with our authentication mechanisms is complicated by the proprietary nature of the mechanisms.

                  <p><em>Consuming</em><br>Company is involved in the issuance and consumption of credentials as “social currency” to prove reputation and ascertain privilege on the Web. A credential is defined as a digitally signed data document that represents authoritative claims issued by primary source data providers to an entity (i.e., person, place or thing.). First major use case: An example would be a nursing license issued by a government agency. The holder of a nursing license credential can offer it via their browser to a web site as proof of required attributes. For instance, if a web site requires a visitor to hold nursing license to gain access, the site would request the nursing identity credential from the visitor’s IdP to authenticate the visitor by inspecting and verifying the provided credential status and authenticity. The nurse should be able to keep private the use of the web site from the IdP. Second major use case: Prior to filling and handing over a prescription to a patient, a pharmacy needs to: ensure the doctor’s credentials are valid and none of them violate a business rule; that the prescription data has not been tampered with; and authenticate the person picking up the prescription is or is appropriately associated with or an official proxy of the patient. Using digital credentials, these processes can be largely automated and streamlined. For example, when a doctor who writes a prescription, a digitally-signed credential can be generated that contains the prescription and an identifier for the intended patient. Linked to the credential can be another credential that contains the doctor’s License, DEA Registration, National Provider Identifier (NPI), Medicare/Medicaid Enrollment Status and Exclusion/Debarment status. The patient can be issued a credential that can be used to prove they are associated with the identifier. The pharmacy prescription system can now independently verify all of the above via these digital credentials at the point of sale terminal or even over the Web.</p>

                  <p><em>Consuming</em><br>Age-restricted consumer products companies (CPGs) have largely been excluded from price-reduced promotions – a $500B market in the US - to targeted consumers largely due to the requirement to ensure the promotion does not encourage under-age sales.  Digital identity can provide value to the consumer, CPG and merchant by opening up this currently closed market to age-restricted sales.  A beer brewer wants to provide a digital promotion to an ‘of age’ consumer.  To obtain the promotion on their mobile, the consumer must prove their age to the beer company (so as not to run afoul of age laws) to obtain the promotion token.  Proof of age must be digital and tokenized, incorporated within the mobile device, and validated by a trusted service provider.  Upon validation of age, the brewer issues the promotion to the mobile, ideally with the age verification token embedded in the promotion token (for validation at POS).   The consumer then selects the promoted product at the convenience store, which is scanned at the POS.  The consumer elects to apply the promotion and passes BOTH the promotion token and age verification token to the POS which matches tokens.  With a successful match, the promotion is applied to the sale and price is discounted.  The store then ‘settles’ the promotion with the brewer; seeking payment from the brewer, retiring the promotion token and posting proof that age verification was assured for proof with regulatory agencies.  This same process – minus the token – can be applied in all age-validated sales within a convenience store; reducing or eliminating the store’s liability to under-age sales and keeping age-restricted products out of the hands of youth</p>

Company will provide, individuals a trusted and verifiable way to share the details of their professional accomplishments to any 3rd party recipient like employers, regulatory bodies and professional organizations.  An open standard would facilitate the transmission of this sort of data with many endpoints, so we can focus on a business model rather than data sharing protocols.</p>

                  <p><em>Consuming</em><br>I think there are two use cases that would be important to Company.  The first is when verifying that new users are who they say they are.  We require that all users have a <a href="http://company.com">company.com</a> account in order to shop with us, so that either results in a returning user signing in or a new user creating an account.  It would be good to have the ability to verify with a credentials solution that the customer signing up with us was who they say they were.  The second case is relative to selling restricted items.  If we had a good way to validate a customer was qualified to purchase that restricted item with us then I think that could eliminate a good deal of friction from the process.</p>

The Health sector have a range of use credential use cases. For example, health practitioners in Country are registered in a national Health Practitioner Index which includes an opaque identifier, name and physical address details, an email/electronic address, and scope of practice. Health professionals send and receive e-prescriptions, e-referrals, e-assessments and other e-documents, and these need to carry identification details and current scope of practice for professionals involved.   The Education sector has a range of credential use cases, although they have not been able to provide examples at this time.  Both government and private sector organisations are interested in the potential credentials that can be provided by registration authorities - most of which has some legislative controls, such as registered engineers, real estate agents, immigration advisors, building practitioners, etc.</p>

                  <p><em>General</em><br>In my opinion the limitations of using credentials is that it is application specific, which limits the possibilities, portability and it is not user friendly. We need a way to use credentials on a layer above the TCP/IP or OSI application layer (e.g. an entity layer), which makes it possible to use it as Credential as a Service (CaaS). It must be taken out the application. This way it is possible to make it user friendly (easier to let the user decide which credentials are given which increases privacy) and increase portablity: the application asks the CaaS server to provide credentials for a specific level of assurance for a specific person, device, organisation or software. It gets information back to prove the asked level of assurance (I have multiple ideas about the how and what in this manner), but the main principle is this.</p>

In the last decade, there has been an enormous growth in the number and variety of labor market certificates, industry certificates, occupational licenses in addition to micro-credentials as badges. This growth has intensified existing confusion among employers, workers, job seekers, students, and policy-makers about the quality and value of offerings in this expanding credentials marketplace–what do these credentials mean, what stands behind them, and how do they relate in terms of relevant features? There has been expressed interest in the DCMI community to support development of an open metadata specification for credential description to address this problem.</p>

          <dd>
          <p>There are important pieces of metadata associated with a particular Credential / Badge:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Colorado State University is creating several recognition certificates to help foster a campus culture of leadership, tolerance and acceptance. The dean’s office defines the criteria and what evidence is accepted to prove that the recipient has met the criteria.</li>
              <li>Green Federal Credit Union has performed Know Your Customer clearing (driver’s license, background check, anti-money laundering blackslist check, etc.), on Reece and would like to issue a credential to him for use at other financial institutions.</li>

This example came from the Open Badges Endorsement Framework Working Paper, which was created by the Badge Alliance Endorsement Working Group.</p>
<p>Motivation</p>
<p>Parties other than a credential’s issuer may be able to add value for certain consumers by endorsing it. An individual recipient’s credential may be endorsed in order for a third party to strengthen the claims it makes about that recipient. A defined credential class may be endorsed by a consumer or other outside entity in order to extend trust to the recipients of that credential among consumer entities who trust the endorser.</p>
<p>Endorsement on self-claims</p>
<p>After Mandy issues herself a credential with the supporting evidence and information, she reaches out to her previous clients including various sized organizations for which she’s done development work requesting they endorse the self-issued credential. Several organizations oblige and endorse the credential.</p>
<p>Motivation</p>
<p>An organization or individual can endorse a self-made claim by a recipient that asserts something specific about herself, such as a qualification, attribute, or the attainment of a particular defined achievement.</p>

    <h2>An Overview of Phases of Credential Usage</h2>

    <p>While the credentials specifications are intended to allow for their use in a variety of industries and scenarios, there are consistent phases to the procedure as defined below.</p>

    <h2>Design Criteria</h2>

    <p>
When exploring systems design, there are concepts that clearly fit into use
cases and concepts apply to all use cases. We are calling the latter class of
concepts <em>design criteria</em>, which are goals that should be kept in mind
while designing the overall credentials system.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Portability</h2>

      <p>
Ensure credentials may be easily moved from one <a>credential service</a>
to another.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
Yannos has been storing all of his credentials at his college credential service
and, upon graduating, would like to move them to a more long-term storage
service. All of the credentials are moved without having to re-issue or
re-assign any of the credentials.
          </li>
        </ul>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Rights</h2>

      <p>
Ensure credentials may be dynamically annotated with acceptable use information
when transmitted to <a>credential consumers</a>.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
Rosa is transmitting her email address to a group buying website and wants to
ensure that her email address will not be used for unsolicited emails. She
attaches a "no advertising" assertion to her email credential to
ensure that it isn't re-transmitted to 3rd parties for advertising purposes.
          </li>

      <h2>Legacy Support</h2>

      <p>
Ensure the Credentials solution can provide an abstraction layer that
integrates with existing authentication methods
(eg: email, username/passwords, etc.)
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
Petra goes to login to a website, but does not have any credentials. She does,
however, have a username/password based account on the website. She is able to
bypass the credential-based login and use a username/password login instead.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Flexible Access Control</h2>

      <p>
Ensure that a <a>recipient</a> may provide access to their credentials
in an interactive and non-interactive manner. Access granted by the credentilee
may be revoked at a later time by the <a>recipient</a>.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
Ralph is buying wine at an online wine store. The wine store interactively
requests a proof-of-age and shipping address credential from Ralph before
completing the transaction.
          </li>
          <li>
The Good Food grocery store requests non-interactive access to each of their
customer's email credentials when they sign up for a loyalty card. If a
product recall notice is ever issued for an item a customer purchased, the
latest email address for the customer is fetched and the product recall notice
is forwarded to the customer.
          </li>
          <li>
Jackie allows TrustMart to automatically retrieve her latest address and phone
credentials. She then receives unsolicited junkmail that she knows came from
TrustMart. She deauthorizes TrustMart from pulling her latest address and phone
credentials.
          </li>
        </ul>

    <section>
      <h2>Reuse and Extend</h2>

      <p>
Consider using existing, widely deployed identity provider mechanisms (e.g.
Facebook Connect, OpenID Connect, G+ Sign-In, etc.) to integrate with the
credential sharing process. Only invent a new mechanism if the current identity
provider mechanisms do not provide the functionality necessary to achieve
the use cases promoted by the group.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
Charlie uses an OpenID Connect login process to login to a website, which also
transmits his credential service URL. The website uses the credential service
URL to request additional credentials that the website needs to verify his
education credentials.
          </li>

      <h2>Identifier Alignment</h2>

      <p>
Enable credentials to be issued by systems in a way that allows each system
to align their internal identifiers with the other.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
Virginia Tech (a university) and the US Department of Education would like to
update the loan status of a particular individual. Both systems support
credentials, but neither of them desire to use the universal identity URL in
their internal systems (due to legacy system limitations). Both systems use a
common internal identifier, such as a loan ID embedded in a credential, to
align the data in both systems with the other.
          </li>

  A learner named Olivia is choosing among summer internships, some of which

  badges that could be used to fulfill an interest-driven learning graduation
  requirement her district has recently implemented. With the additional
  information provided to her by the school’s endorsement of certain badges,
  her choice among internships is made much simpler. This example came from the

  Horizon Learning (HL) develops healthcare professional development modules.
  Health Education Alliance (HEA) is an industry association that provides
  professional development rating services for providers and specific learning
  modules. Emily works at Health Services International (HSI) and needs to take
  professional development courses. Her company pays 50% of the cost for modules
  she takes if they are endorsed by HEA.

          </ul>

          <p class="ednote">
  The last two examples are using a different definition of "endorsement" than
  the first two examples. The first two examples use a more technical definition,
  which is "endorsement as a layering or multiple signatures on a single
  credential (aka: the service provided by a notary public or witness)".
  The last two examples use a more functional definition, which is
  "endorsement as an official approval of a certain type of credential by a 3rd
  party (aka: the service provided by an accrediting organization)". Clearly all
  the use cases are valid, but we need to either define what "endorsement"
  means, or use other language that won't confuse readers (or both).
