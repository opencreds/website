    <p>This document is the architecture vision statment of the W3C Credentials Community Group. It describes the principles upon which a Credentials architecture should be built.</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/">mission</a> of the Credentials Community Group is to standardize a mechanism for exchanging provably-authentic claims via the Web. Examples of claims may be qualifications, achievements, qualities, or pieces of information about an entity such as a name, government ID, payment provider, home address, or university degree.</p>

    <h2>Web Principles</h2>
    <p>
Any architecture grounded in the Web should respect well-known Web principles such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Adhering to Web architecture fundamentals,</li>
      <li>Supporting network independence,</li>
      <li>Supporting device independence,</li>
      <li>Providing accessibility for <a>issuers</a> and <a>requestors</a> with disabilities,</li>
      <li>Being machine-readable where possible to enable automation and engagement of non-human entities,</li>
      <li>Protecting the privacy of all participants, and</li>
      <li>Being open and usable by anyone, including those who are not yet connected to the Web.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Desireable properties of a Credentials Architecture</h2>

    <section>
      <h3>Creates a vibrant credentialing ecosystem</h3>
      <p>Credentials should be <strong>interoperable</strong> and <strong>portable</strong>. A credential should used by as broad of a range of organizations as possible. The recipient of a credential should be able to store, archive, and migrate credentials throughout their lifetime with relative ease. All participants in the ecosystem should have a wide variety of choices when it comes to credential issuing, storage, management, and consuming applications.</p>
      <p class="ednote">What about earners</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Broadly applicable to many people and industries</h3>
      <p>The ecosystem <strong>should scale to the 3 billion people</strong> using the Web today, and the 6 billion people that will be using the Web by the year 2020. Catering to <strong>accessibility</strong> should be a fundamental design criteria, as 10% of the world's population have disabilities and the solution should be usable by as much of the world's population as possible.</p>
    </section> 

    <section>
      <h3>Privacy enhancing and recipient controlled</h3>
      <p>The process of exchanging a credential should be <strong>privacy enhancing</strong> and <strong>recipient controlled</strong> such that the system protects the privacy of the individual or organization using the credential by placing the recipient in control of who is allowed to access their credential.</p>
    </section> 

    <section>
      <h3>Secure, decentralized, and trustworthy</h3>
      <p>Credentials should be <strong>independently verifiable</strong> where the veracity of claims made by a credential should be verifiable using the credential itself. The system should use cryptographic best practices to achieve a secure and decentralized design that is resistant to vendor lock in.</p>
    </section> 

    <section>
      <h3>Enables automation and extensibility</h3>
      <p>The data format for a credential should be <strong>machine-readable</strong> to enable automation. The data format should also be <strong>extensible</strong> where different industry vertical-specific solutions can be built without unnecessary central coordination.</p>
    </section> 

    <section>
      <h3>Facilitates legal and regulatory compliance</h3>
      <p>The Web is a global system which must operate across many legal and regulatory jurisdictions.</p>
      <p>While there are common requirements across jurisdictions, it is not cost-effective to create a single system that satisfies all legal and regulatory obligations in all jurisdictions.</p>
      <p>As a result, a successful architecture for credentials on the Web will account for variability with regard to legal and regulatory frameworks it can support. The group envisions an extensible set of 'hooks' that enable participant-authorized parties to comply with legal and regulatory requirements in different jurisdictions in a secure and more standard manner.</p>
    </section> 

    <section>
      <h3>Enables commercialization of Web and native apps</h3>
      <p>Web developers will be able to integrate credentials smoothly into a variety of user experiences on the Web, including in-app authorization and high-stakes Web access. This is key to opening up new revenue generating opportunities on the Web that were not previously viable due to the costs incurred and poor user experiences required in requesting and processing credentials.</p>
